To David:

It seperate in to three part:
                  Documentation: all the document generate during the development
                  Android:       main and each module app in seperate folder
                  Arduino:       the programe load on the arduino board and the library.
                 
To others:
  This is the source code for the ME 435 final project in the 2018 Rose-Hulman spring quarter. It may not make sense to you at all as the project might vary between quarters.
